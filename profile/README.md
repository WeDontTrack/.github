Welcome to the "We Don't Track" organization on GitHub! We are dedicated to developing applications that prioritize user privacy and data protection. 

## How and Why this Org..

Well there is no exact reason to work with it, its side a time killer to work on ideas and create applications that do have same functionalities as in daily applications but without any tracking and ads etc

## About Us

Just a couple of people [@vijay2249](https://github.com/vijay2249) & [@iredith](https://github.com/iredith) working on problems irritating us in our daily life. With no data collection and ads popping up.

Principles of the development process:

- **Privacy First:** We don't collect or sell your personal information.
- **Open Source:** We believe in transparency and encourage collaboration.
- **User Empowerment:** Our software puts you in control of your data and digital experiences.
